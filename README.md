# Graduation Analysis – Everything Data

This project analyzes graduation outcomes for Data Science students at **Everything Data**, uncovering the factors influencing successful completion of the program.

## 🧠 Project Overview
The analysis explores key variables such as study hours, prior experience, motivation, gender, and country, and how they relate to graduation rates. It uses:
- **Pandas** and **NumPy** for data cleaning and analysis  
- **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib** for visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** and **XGBoost** for model training and evaluation  
- **SHAP** for model explainability  

## ⚙️ Workflow
1. Load and preprocess data  
2. Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
3. Build and compare multiple classification models  
4. Evaluate best-performing model using F1-score  
5. Interpret key predictors of graduation using SHAP  

## 🧩 Insights
- Increased weekly study hours correlate with higher graduation rates.  
- Prior experience in data science improves completion likelihood.  
- Targeted academic and mentorship support benefits low scorers and beginners.
